# PADDY-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION
INTRODUCTION 
Manual disease detection in paddy crops is inefficient, subjective, and prone to errors, affecting yield and productivity.
A deep learning-based approach leveraging thermal imaging for precise and automated paddy leaf disease detection.
Utilizes ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)keypoints for feature extraction and Grad-CAM for model interpretability, improving accuracy and transparency.
Deep Learning Models – Implements MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and for robust classification, enabling early disease diagnosis and timely intervention.

Paddy leaf disease detection using deep learning trains neural networks on leaf images for accurate disease identification, enabling early detection and reducing crop losses. The ORB efficiently extracts key features, integrated with advanced DL models (ResNet50, and MobileNetV2) to enhance accuracy. Thermal imaging detects changes before symptoms appear, supporting proactive management. Grad-CAM visualization ensures interpretability, fostering trust in automated solutions. This approach advances AI-driven plant health monitoring, contributing to sustainable agriculture and improved crop management through efficient early disease detection.
